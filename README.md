# OpenVTT

**An open-source, self-hosted alternative to Foundry VTT**

## Vision

OpenVTT aims to be a fully open-source Virtual Tabletop (VTT) platform that provides a modern, flexible alternative to existing solutions. Built with transparency and community ownership in mind, OpenVTT empowers game masters and players to host their own virtual tabletop experiences without vendor lock-in or licensing restrictions.

## Key Features

### System-Agnostic Design
OpenVTT is designed to work with any tabletop role-playing game system. Whether you're running D&D 5e, Pathfinder, Call of Cthulhu, or a custom homebrew system, OpenVTT provides the tools you need without forcing you into a specific framework.

### Plugin Architecture
Extensibility is at the core of OpenVTT. A robust plugin system allows the community to build and share custom features, game system implementations, and integrations. Extend functionality to match your specific needs and playstyle.

### Fully Open Source
Complete transparency and freedom. The entire codebase is open source, giving you full control over your VTT instance. Review the code, contribute improvements, or customize it to your heart's content.

### Self-Hosted
Take complete control of your data and infrastructure. Host OpenVTT on your own servers, ensuring privacy, security, and independence from third-party services. Your games, your data, your rules.

## Project Status

**🚧 Work in Progress**

OpenVTT is currently in active development. The project is being built with modern web technologies and is evolving rapidly. Contributions, feedback, and community involvement are welcome as we work toward a stable release.

## Architecture

OpenVTT consists of two main components:

- **Client** (`openvtt-client`): Next.js-based web application providing the user interface
- **Server** (`openvtt-server`): NestJS backend API handling game logic, data persistence, and real-time synchronization
